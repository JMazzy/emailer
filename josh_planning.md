    messages
    labels (like folders and other types of labels)
    drafts (holds a message, but has its own id)
    history (list of all changes to a mailbox)

Questions
  * how to handle email retrieval?
    * rails app gets data in big packages and stores/updates db?
  * do we even have to store email on our server?
    * just use rails for users and authentication
    * make requests to gmail directly from Restangular?
      * is that secure?

Server Side or client side pagination?
