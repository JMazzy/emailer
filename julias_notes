=======================
Mailyt gem is pretty much what we're trying to build:

Gems: devise, ActionMailer
controllers: emails, email_accounts



=======================
BASIC FEATURES:

- sign up/ sign in
- link gmail account to our mailer
- receive and send emails


ADD-ONS:
- search emails
- mark emails unread
- add attachments (Paperclip, S3?)
- group emails in folders
- integrate with other mail servers


=========================
RAILS API

- use devise and current_user architecture?
- access to email address, password
- gmail gem is basically a wrapper for gmail API
- Angular talks to gmail gem that resides in rails




=========================
ANGULAR FRONTEND?

- on page load, resolve grabs 50 most recent emails

- 'refresh' button makes an API call for new emails
- directive for each email row?
- pagination with angularUtils
